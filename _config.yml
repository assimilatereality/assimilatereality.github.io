title: Effecting Affordances
description: "There are Affordances in every environment. It takes Effectivities to use them. Exploring the intersection of perception frameworks and complex systems: this blog examines how effectivities (our capabilities) interact with affordances (environmental possibilities) to shape our approach to technical architecture and troubleshooting. Drawing from evolutionary psychology, systems thinking, and cognitive science, we investigate how mental models influence our ability to navigate increasingly complex digital landscapesâ€”where the balance between reality-based understanding and fitness-based heuristics determines our effectiveness in designing resilient, antifragile systems."
